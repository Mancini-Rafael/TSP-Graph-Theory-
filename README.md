# TSP-Graph-Theory-
THIS PROGRAM GENERATES THE BEST SOLUTION (LOWEST COST) FOR A HAMILTONIAN CICLE GIVEN A GRAPH (ALSO KNOWN AS THE TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM). IT WAS DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE FINAL PROJECT OF A COLLEGE CLASS BY RAFAEL L MANCINI, LUIS FERNANDO BEVILACQUA AND VICTORIA PS. IT HAS AN EXACT METHOD GENERATED BY EXHAUSTION, A EDGE SWAP METHOD AND A SIMMULATED ANNEALING METHOD. THE PROGRAM TAKES THE GRAPH INFORMATION AS A .IN FILE THAT CAN BE CREATED IN ANY TEXT EDITOR.
